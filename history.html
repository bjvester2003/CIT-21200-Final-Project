                <p>Saladin was very wise in the ways of war. Early in his life he gained experience in the army of his uncle, a renowned battlefield commander. In time, however, Saladin became a great leader in his own right. Over the course of several decades, Saladin fought many battles with european crusaders. At times, Saladin even captured Jerusalem and faced off against the legendary Richard the Lionheart.</p>
                <p>In Age of Empires, players lead Saladin's army as he defends Cairo, Sieges Jerusalem, and stares into the jaws of the Great Enlish Lion.</p>
